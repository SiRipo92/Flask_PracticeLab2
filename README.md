# Transactions Tracker - CRUD Application

This is a **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application designed for tracking financial transactions, developed as part of the **Hands-on Lab in Module 2** of the **Python "Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask" Course** by **IBM** on **Coursera**.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **financial transaction recording system** using Flask. The system enables users to:

- **Create** new transaction entries
- **Read** and view the list of transactions
- **Update** existing transaction details
- **Delete** transaction entries

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Flask structure:

### Key Files:

- `app.py`: The main application script that defines the routes and logic for CRUD operations.
- `/templates/`: Contains HTML templates for rendering the pages:
  - `transactions.html`: Displays a list of transactions with options to add, edit, or delete.
  - `form.html`: Contains the form for adding a new transaction.
  - `search.html`: A form to filter transactions based on a range of amounts.
  - `edit.html`: A form for editing an existing transaction.
- `/static/`: Directory for any static assets like CSS or JavaScript files (if applicable).

## Features

- **Create**: Add new transaction entries by specifying a date and amount.
- **Read**: View the list of transactions in a table format.
- **Update**: Edit transaction details (date and amount).
- **Delete**: Remove transactions from the list.
- **Total Balance Calculation**: Display the total balance of all transactions at the bottom of the records table.

## Installation
